Riot QA Tech Internship Challenge


Hello! My name is Thomas Huang and I've been a League summoner since Season 3. This is my program to calculate the most efficient spell in League of Legends.

Each spell's efficiency score is based on the following parameters: Base Values, AD/AP Ratios and given AD/AP Values, Spell Costs, Cooldown, and Range. 

With the default values of AD=200 and AP=200, the most efficient spell in League of Legends is Katarina's ultimate due to its extremely high AP and bonus AD ratios. With 100 AD and 0 AP (the rough equivalent of no items), the most efficient spell is Nunu's Consume because of its very high base damages (albeit only on minions). 

Other very efficient spells include Mordekaiser's Mace of Spades because of its non-mana cost, low cooldown and high base damages/ratios and also Jinx's Zap! due to its high AD ratio, long range, and 70% slow at rank 5.

If you have any questions or comments, I would love to talk more, so <a href="mailto:thomashuang2016@u.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">contact me!</a> All data in this program in this program is taken from <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/" target="_blank">the Riot Games API</a>, and all spell icons were downloaded from <a href="http://ec2-174-129-110-117.compute-1.amazonaws.com/tool/" target="_blank">DDragon</a>.
